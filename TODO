- some other fragility around drag/drops and timings
- games maintaining a deck might benefit from pushing that to the dealer
- make rotation a function of the distance snapped (for all card stack types?) :)
- weird concertina when dragging a pile in patience
- restart button

- web hosting needs a better index.html
- instructions

- demo
  - dragging off a pile (not the deck) in demo.js drops the card where it is
  - clicking rotated cards in test1 invokes another rotation

- clock
  - variable card sizes - arrange in a circle?

- patience
  - double click a card to send it to a suit
  - decorate the piles aces
  - settings 
    - turn deck
	- shuffle after turning
	- only king on space

- that instagram game (accordion) - https://www.instagram.com/p/DENFxlMxzf6/
  - might need some dynamic pile animations :D
  - deal three cards to start
  - then deal one at a time underneath
  - numbers and suits can stack to the left or above
  - cards move left to fill gaps left by upshifts
  - having 1 pile left at the end is a "perfect" game -- three is good according to the vid
  - video gets as many as five rows, briefly - we could do it with columns ...
