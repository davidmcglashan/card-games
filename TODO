- cards rather than piles need click & drag affordances
  - pile canDrop etc. needs to change since we really only consider empty piles
  - after that it's dropping on cards ...
- sloppy piles tend diagonally up and left
- hand icon pointers!
- disable text selection and stuff
- web hosting
- some other fragility around drag/drops and timings
- clicking rotated cards in test1 invokes another rotation
- replace getBoundingClientRect() with a clever abstraction to be used in ifs
  - if checkUI.bounds( pile, x, y )
  - returns boundingrect
- games maintaining a deck might benefit from pushing that to the dealer

- instructions

- patience
  - decorate the piles aces in regular patience

- that instagram game (accordion) - https://www.instagram.com/p/DENFxlMxzf6/
  - might need some dynamic pile animations :D
