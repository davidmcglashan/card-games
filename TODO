- dragged cards move into #glass and drop back to #cards
- drop affordances for piles with cards on them

- animate the snaps 
- decorate the card backs
- decorate the card fronts
- handle the window resizing 'cos the cards don't
- Make restart work again
- pile stacking offsets (tight, diagonal, loose)
- end game state detection

- patience
- clock patience
- that instagram game (accordion) - https://www.instagram.com/p/DENFxlMxzf6/
