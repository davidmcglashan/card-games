- sloppy piles tend diagonally up and left
- pointers discerning clicks and drags
- web hosting
- some other fragility around drag/drops and timings
- clicking rotated cards in test1 invokes another rotation
- games maintaining a deck might benefit from pushing that to the dealer
- dragging off a pile in demo.js prevents further drops to it - is it "leaving a card in there"?
- game switcher at top
- clock patience card sizes

- instructions

- patience
  - decorate the piles aces
  - settings 
    - turn deck
	- shuffle after turning
	- only king on space

- that instagram game (accordion) - https://www.instagram.com/p/DENFxlMxzf6/
