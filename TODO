- common CSS for glyphs and labels on piles e.g. "drop an ace here"
- make rotation a function of the distance snapped (for all card stack types?) :)
- textures/noise on the table green

GAMES
-----
- aces up

  - arrangement tweaks to the circle e.g. centralise, calc() involved in layout
  - setting for auto-turning the next card

- patience
  - double click a card to send it to a suit
  - fast clicking on the deck draws cards too fast which messes up the order and confuses the game logic.

  - keeping all the cards and dragging whole piles!

- streets & alleys
