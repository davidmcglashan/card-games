- sloppy piles tend diagonally up and left
- web hosting
- some other fragility around drag/drops and timings
- games maintaining a deck might benefit from pushing that to the dealer
- game switcher at top
- make rotation a function of the distance snapped (for all card stack types?) :)
- weird concertina when dragging a pile in patience
- restart button

- instructions

- demo
  - dragging off a pile in demo.js prevents further drops to it - is it "leaving a card in there"?
  - clicking rotated cards in test1 invokes another rotation

- clock
  - variable card sizes - arrange in a circle?

- patience
  - game over detection and messages!
  - double click a card to send it to a suit
  - decorate the piles aces
  - settings 
    - turn deck
	- shuffle after turning
	- only king on space

- that instagram game (accordion) - https://www.instagram.com/p/DENFxlMxzf6/
  - might need some dynamic pile animations :D
