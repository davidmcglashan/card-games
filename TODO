- pile stacking offsets (tight, diagonal, loose)
- hand icon pointers!
- web hosting
- some other fragility around drag/drops and timings
- clicking rotated cards in test1 invokes another rotation
- test1 doesn't restart properly any more - rotations and weird card orders.

- instructions

- patience
  - decorate the piles aces in regular patience

- that instagram game (accordion) - https://www.instagram.com/p/DENFxlMxzf6/
